# Kovai.co_ASSEMENT 
Here I fetched, added, updated and deleted data using http request which includes
* GET-> to fetch
* POST->to send
* PUT->to update a given data
* DELETE->to delete a data
  In order to work with this API, I used JS
  ->there I handled promise, i.e negative statement falls into the catch
                                positive statement falls into the then
